This module presents a ballistic model that describes how ribosomes move along an mRNA strand while accounting for the finite lifetime of mRNA molecules. This approach uses Ribo-seq data grouped by the number of ribosomes per mRNA (called k-somes, e.g., monosomes, disomes, trisomes, and tetrasomes). By analyzing these groups, the model enables estimation of key kinetic parameters: initiation, elongation, and degradation rates.
